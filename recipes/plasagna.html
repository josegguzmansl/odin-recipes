      <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
      <li>10 Yellow Matured Plantain</li>
      <li>1kg Grated Mozzarella Chesse</li>
      <li>Grated Parmisan Cheese</li>
      <li>1kg Minced Meat</li>
      <li>1 Onion</li>
      <li>1 Handfull of Chives</li>
      <li>1 Tomato</li>
      <li>1 Green Bell Pepper</li>
      <li>1/2 Red Bell Pepper</li>
      <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
      <li>Frying Oil</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      With all of these in hand, grab a cutting knife, cutting board, baking
      trail and some tweezers and let's get to work.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <h3>Preparation:</h3>
      <li>Cut all those veggies into small cubes</li>
      <li>
        In a big pan add some oil and throw all those veggies to soft fry them
        until onions are golden.
      </li>
      <li>
        add your minced meat and combine them with your cooked veggies, salt and
        pepper to your heart's desire. close your pan and let the meat release
        all the juice, then remove the lid and let the juice zimmer down and
        your meat is done.
      </li>
      <li>
        Now cut all your plantain in long horizotal stripes, as you were trying
        to make thick lasagna sheets out of those plantains make sure your
        sheets are at least 1cm thick.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a deep pan with generous frying oil, fry your plantain stripes until
        that yellow turns into ambarish red.
      </li>
      <li>
        When all of that is ready grab your baking trail and start setting the
        lasagna with rotations in capes of plantain, meat, mozarella until trail
        is top off.
      </li>
      <li>
        On top add some mozarella and bake for 10min at medium heat so your
        cheese gratinates.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      And that's it! Now you can taste this creation of the gods, top each
      serving with parmisan and enjoy this delightful meal.
