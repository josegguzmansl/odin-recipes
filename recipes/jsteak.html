        Unless you vowed not to eat meat (Wish I respect) most of us meat loving
        folks there is a special place in in our heart for a delicious Steak, And
        i wish to show you my take on a Awesome steak that my grandma tought me to
        make.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of you surely are used to big juice loins of meat that you call
        steaks, but my granny here actually cutted her meat thin enough for a
        milanesa styled cut So this means this steak is not to be eaten alone,
        rice, pasta, mashed potatoes you name it, its good with all. As she
        explained, a steak should always be nicely cooked and seasoned enough to
        make it juicy so without any further to explain. This is the recipe.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="recipe">
      <ul>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <li>1kg of Thin cutted meat steaks</li>
        <li>1 Onion</li>
        <li>1 Tomato</li>
        <li>1 Egg</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Pepper</li>
        <li>Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>Soy Sauce</li>

      </ul>
      <p>
        I know this is a lot, overall to be absorbed by a thin slice of meat but
        this recipe is not for Expensive high quality meat that you could enjoy
        its grease and bite, no, with this, you can make you tongue go thru a
        travel of flavours without with questionably quality meat. Plus im not
        saying this is the best way to make a steak, just my way to make my steak.
        Gotta love Caribbean cousine just adding everything in your countertop to
        anything and guess what, it will work somehow.
